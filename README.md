# Warehouse Management Web App
This web application allows users to manage warehouses and their respective inventories. Users can add, update, and delete warehouses and their items, as well as view all existing data. The application includes user authentication and authorization, with role-based access control for regular users and administrators. The Web App was created using Python and Flask, and it leverages an SQLite database for data storage.
